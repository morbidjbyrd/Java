/*
all numeric literals and string literals are declared as constants
declare variables (primitive and referential data types)
initialize all variables that must have values before use, e.g., those that are referenced before they are defined
initialization must occur either during or right after declaration, and within housekeeping
input section has appropriate prompts
input section stores input in correct variables
process section performs all calculations
process section performs processing of data for output
process section demonstrates concatenation at least once
output section does not use println method
output is user-friendly, contains complete sentences, and is both spelling and grammatically correct
